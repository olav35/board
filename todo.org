* TODO Implement post viewing
* TODO Implement post creating
* TODO Implement routes
* TODO Add styling
* TODO Deploy to Heroku
* TODO Add post numbers
* TODO Add quoting / greentexting
* TODO Add anonymized rss feeds.
That is feeds that show when there is a new post and a link to it without any other info about the post. Perhaps a email feed would be better suited, but that is hard to make.
* TODO voice chat
This one is kind of far fetched, but using WebRTC along with something like PeerJS I could add an anonymous voice / videochat feature into my app.

I believe this would leak the IPs of the voice chat participants, but that is okay if I add a disclaimer.
