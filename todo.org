- [ ] Add quoting / greentexting
- [ ] Add anonymized rss feeds.

- [ ] voice chat

  This one is kind of far fetched, but using WebRTC along with something like PeerJS I could add an anonymous voice / videochat feature into my app.

  I believe this would leak the IPs of the voice chat participants, but that is okay if I add a disclaimer.
- [ ] Add banners
- [ ] Add stickies
- [ ] Add recent commits overview
  I could fetch the recent commits from the GitHub repository and display them under the start-a-new-thread-button as a news feed of sorts
